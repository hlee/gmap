The cucumber features provided here demonstrate some of the features of the rails3-mongoid-devise example app.

This example app combines [Mongoid](http://mongoid.org/) with [Devise](http://github.com/plataformatec/devise). Mongoid is a datastore that gives you quick development without schemas or migrations. Devise gives you ready-made authentication and user management.

The [rails3-mongoid-devise](https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise) app is on GitHub.

If you have ideas to clarify or improve any of these cucumber features, please submit a [GitHub issue](http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise/issues) or pull request.
